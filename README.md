Hi, Iâ€™m @Ashihad, Grzesiek if you prefer,

I'm an Engineering Physics student from Poland with an unreachable goal of getting to know everything about everything, mostly STEM related.

I'm currently using this account to backup my small getting-to-know-the-basics-of-programming projects,
written mostly in Python C, C++ and maybe some web technologies.

Hi, Iâ€™m @Ashihad, Grzesiek if you prefer,

I'm an Engineering Physics student from Poland with an unreachable goal of getting to know everything about everything, mostly STEM related.

I'm currently using this account to backup my small getting-to-know-the-basics-of-programming projects,
written mostly in Python C, C++ and maybe some web technologies.

If You stumble across this profile and see some horrendous looking code that You just cannot stand looking at 
or You want to contact me for any other reason, reach me at grzegorz.esser@wp.pl

I'm hoping for the best, wish me luck!
